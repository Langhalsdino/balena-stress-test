# Balena Stress Test

If you want to stress test your Linux devices, this multi-container application is the perfect one for you! When deployed to your fleet of devices, this application will run four (4) stress test services, to ensure maximum CPU utilization. There's an additional container that simply emits the CPU package temperature once per second.

In the balenaCloud console, you can open your Application and view the container logs, similar to the screenshot below.
